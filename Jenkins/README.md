#Jenkins
Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java.

Continuous Integration, in its simplest form, involves a tool that monitors your version control system
for changes. Whenever a change is detected, this tool automatically compiles and tests your application.
If something goes wrong, the tool immediately notifies the developers so that they can fix the issue
immediately.

Continuous Integration is about reducing risk by providing faster feedback

designed to help identify and fix integration and regression issues faster, resulting in
smoother, quicker delivery, and fewer bugs

#Continuous Integration helps you
#get your software into the hands of the testers and the end users faster, more reliably, and with less effort.

#The practice of automatically deploying every successful build directly into production is
#generally known as Continuous Deployment.
