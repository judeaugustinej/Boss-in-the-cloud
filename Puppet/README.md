```
Puppet is an open-source tool that helps system administrators manage server configurations

```
Puppet uses the client/server model. The master server runs puppetmasterd,
which stores the configuration description and resource files for several server nodes,
while the clients run puppetd.
The client servers regularly connect to the master server to synchronize their configurations and 
report any local changes back to the central nodes. It’s also possible to run just a single client,
which checks in with the master node either at specified intervals, or with a manual pull operation.
